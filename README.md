## Getting started

Install the dependency into your `pubspec.yaml` with the follow

```
dev_dependencies:
  simple_deploy: latest_version # e.g. ^0.8.0

Create a `deploy.yaml` file at the root of your project and configure it

Here is an example version of `deploy.yaml`

```

  versionStrategy: "none"

android:
  credentialsFile: "c:/credentials/project-credentials.json"
  packageName: "com.example.coolapp"
  trackName: "internal"
  whatsNew: "Simple bug fixes"
  # Optional: specify an alternate entry point file (defaults to lib/main.dart)
  targetFile: "lib/flavors/internal_main.dart"

ios:
  teamKeyId: "ABCD1A4A12"
  developerId: "76a6aa66-e80a-67e9-e987-6a1c711a4b2
  # Optional: specify an alternate entry point file (defaults to lib/main.dart)
  targetFile: "lib/flavors/internal_main.dart"
```
